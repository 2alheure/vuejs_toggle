# vuejs_toggle
Simple VueJS toggle button, made with TailwindCSS.

It has been inspired by [this article by ALEXANDRU STRATULAT](https://sandulat.com/blog/custom-switch-with-tailwind-and-vue), so check it out if you wish to understand how it works. 

You will have to customize it while it only has a `value` props passed, and nothing more.

## How to use it

1. Put the `Toggle.vue` file into your `components/` directory.
2. In the component in which you need to use it, import it via `import Toggle from "@/components/Toggle.vue";`
3. Use it : `<Toggle v-model="foobar" />`
That's all!
