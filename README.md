# vuejs_toggle
Simple VueJS toggle button, made with TailwindCSS.

It has been inspired by [this article by ALEXANDRU STRATULAT](https://sandulat.com/blog/custom-switch-with-tailwind-and-vue), so check it out if you wish to understand how it works. 

You will have to customize it while it only has a `value` props passed, and nothing more.
